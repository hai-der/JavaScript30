    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let original = 100;
    let reference = 100;
    console.log(original, reference); // 100 100
    
    original = 200;
    console.log(original, reference); // 200 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const playersCopy = players;

    console.log(players, playersCopy);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    playersCopy[2] = 'Malfoy';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team = players.slice();
    const team2 = [].concat(players); // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [...players];     // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[2] = 'Abbangale Jr.';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; // this changes person.number too

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 } );
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
